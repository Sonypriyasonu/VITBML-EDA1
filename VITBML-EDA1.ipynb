        "taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced\n",
        "inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the\n",
        "atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks\n",
        "through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction\n",
        "of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by\n",
        "the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a\n",
        "plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of\n",
        "few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns\n",

        "in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse.\n",
        "If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be\n",
        "an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse\n",
        "(often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be\n",
        "used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric\n",
        "along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination.\n",
        "There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the\n",
